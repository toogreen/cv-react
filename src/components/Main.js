                                Cross-campus coordinator for a series of primary schools in Shanghai (Xiehe Education Group). I acted as an advisor, system administrator, facilitator and teacher. My tasks included managing the IT infrastructures across campuses and administrating the school’s web servers, databases, e-mail, FTP, Administration desk, etc. I have also deployed a Learning Management System (Moodle) and developed several web apps and databases for administrative functions (PHP+MySQL). On top of that, I was also providing technical support and training to teachers, as well as teaching ICT to primary and secondary school students. I followed the IB curriculum program as well as IPC and the English National Curriculum.

Managed several file servers (Samba+NFS) as well as a mail server (postfix+courier) and a few web servers (LAMP stack). Always hungry for learning more and improving my knowledgebase, I've recently earned LPI's Linux Essentials certification, and currently working towards getting my LPIC-1 and LPIC-2 certifications as well.

                                I have been teaching for over 9 years in Shanghai. Taught English then ICT to children aged from 5 to 14 years old. Also gave several trainings to adults on Open Source IT systems such as LibreOffice and Moodle. Having a natural desire to learn and share my up-to-date knowledge, even back when I was a graphic design student, I was asked to assist some of the teachers in giving support to other students and I even helped in preparing and updating some of course contents.

                                On a very tight budget, we needed to build a website in the least amount of time as well.

                                Used HTML5, CSS3, PHP and jQuery technologies to make everything work as it should.
                                The website presenting a couple of challenges later on a well, for instance adapting all the PHP templates 
                                from being simply bilingual (French + English) to a tri-lingual version (added Spanish recently).

                                This private clinic needed a brand new, better looking Wordpress-based website.
                                Starting from an exisiting template, I have modified its code heavily using CSS3 and jQuery to add some new features, such as making the main pictures becoming in color when rolling the mouse over them, as well as adding sub-menus and right sidebar, etc.
                                It was the first time I used jQuery extensively and some interesting CSS3 newer features.

                                I have extended this in-house developed management system, based on PHP and MySQL by building on top of its original source code. At the time I left, this system was still being used to manage information about students, take daily attendance, set up buses, write comments, etc. My contribution consists in two modules that I created from scratch and integrated into the existing system:
        
                                <ol>
                                    <li>On-line reports web interface which allows teachers to input students' grades, as well as store, view and print reports directly on-line.</li>
                                    <li>A web interface allowing teachers to input their lesson plans directly on-line and from home, as well as sharing them with other teachers. </li>
                                </ol>
                            </p>
                        </div>				
                    </div>
        
                    <div className="subsection grid2">
                        <div className="right-column">
                            <h3>photojournaliste.ca</h3>
                            <p>
                                A website I've built in 2003 for a photographer friend which was also based in Shanghai. He needed a website to promote himself and his portfolio. 
                                This was the very first website in which I used the PHP and MySQL technologies.
                                Again I've done everything, from scanning the original pictures from film, to graphic design then HTML slicing and PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming. 
                                Thanks to PHP/MySQL, this website could be easily updated by his owner, for example adding text or photos, without having to do any programming or requiring my assistance.
